  <h1>Hi! I am Hrishikesh Pathak</h1>
  <p>
    I am a programmer and content creator. I am good at problem-solving. I learn
    programming on my own. By watching youtube videos and reading blogs. I spend
    countless hours in programming and created many projects. This website is
    one of my recent projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am trying to make a little place of my own on this vast internet. A place
    that I control. There is no one who can censor my content on this website. I
    also suggest you build a place like this for your own. Where you share your
    thoughts independently, hesitantly.
  </p>
  <p>
    I publish <a href="/blog">programming-related content</a>. Whenever I learn
    something new, I write it down on this website. I also make
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HrishikeshPathak">youtube videos</a>.
    Thank you for taking the time to read this. If you want any help related to
    programming, <a href="mailto:hrishikeshb2pathak@gmail.com">drop a mail</a>.
    I will try to help you out.
  </p>
  <p>Have a great day my internet friend!</p>
